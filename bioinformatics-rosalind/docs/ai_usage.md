# AI Assistance Notes

I used ChatGPT to:
- Clarify the problem requirements for Rosalind problems 1â€“9.
- Debug Python code (loops, conditionals, file parsing, dictionaries, etc.) in Colab.
- Verify outputs (DNA counts, RNA transcription, protein translation, GC content, etc.).
- Guide me through setting up the repository structure and preparing the submission.

All final code execution and validation was done by me in Google Colab.
